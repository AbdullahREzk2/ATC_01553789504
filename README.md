Areeb Technology Competition â€“ Backend Project
This project was developed as part of the Areeb Technology Competition. I focused solely on the backend implementation due to my limited experience with frontend development.

What's Included :
A complete ASP.NET Core Web API project (zipped).
A SQL Server database file.

How to Run the Project
Import the database into your local SQL Server instance.
Extract and open the project in Visual Studio.
Run the project without making any changes.
Once running, the Swagger UI will launch automatically in your browser.
Use Swagger to explore and test the available API endpoints.

Notes
All endpoints are documented and testable via Swagger.
You can use these endpoints in your frontend or testing environments as needed.
